# PokemonRockPaperScisorsLizardSpock
This is a little WIP project based on the Pokemon combat formula but with the rules of Rock Paper Scisors Lizard Spock.

I put the project on hold since the core combat loop was "done" (which was my goal to try and do scalable for any entity) and I wanted to do different things. I plan to finish it in my free time.

For now you can see what was done in the develop branch.
